<h3 class="mainTitle">Extension Points</h3>

<p>When you configure CCC components, you can see that the most commonly used properties such as width and height, title, legends or colors are already implemented. However you may notice that the charts lack some other properties as, for example, the font for the x-axis, or the rotation angle for the y-labels.</p>
<p>Not only that: you know that Protovis has those features; it just happens that CCC has not implemented them yet. It is not the end of the world. Certainly you can live without those particular features, but if you really want to configure those attributes in your chart, you're lucky because you can define an extension point.</p>
<p>An Extension Point is a CCC concept that allows you to implement all the Protovis properties not implemented directly in CCC. When defining an extension point you have to provide a <code>name</code> and a <code>value</code>.</p>

<span class="example">NAME FORMAT</span>
<pre>&lt;CCC identification&gt; + _ + &lt;Protovis_property_name&gt;</pre>

<p>For example for defining the angle for the <i>y-label</i> you define an extension point named <code>yAxisLabel_textAngle</code>. A CCC component can have as many extension points as you need.</p>
<p>You can find a list of the supported protovis properties right here, on each chart type's page, on the <a class="spacialink" href="http://community.pentaho.com/ctools/charts/jsdoc" target="_blank">CCC reference documentation page</a>, or, even, in the <a class="spacialink" href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/jsdoc/" target="_blank">Protovis documentation page</a>.</p>
