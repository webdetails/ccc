<h3 class="mainTitle">Protovis</h3>

<p><a class="spacialink" href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/" target="_blank" title="Protovis Homepage">Protovis</a> is a visualization library that seamlessly integrates with our tools.</p>
<p>Unlike low-level graphics libraries, Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode data, allowing inheritance, scales and layouts to simplify the construction of charts.</p>

<h4>Main Features</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It's free and open-source, provided under the BSD License.</li>
	<li>It's written in JavaScript and runs on the browser without requiring any plugins;</li>
	<li>Its graphics are also viewable on a selected list of mobile devices;</li>
	<li>It requires a modern browser, which means any recent version of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera or IE8 or later;</li>
	<li>Despite being designed for custom visualization, it allows you to create standard chart types such as areas, bars, scatterplots, pies & donuts, lines and step charts in a very easy way.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protovis Version</h4>
<p>During the creation of CCC, we had to make some changes / improvements to Protovis itself. We're using a patched version of Protovis 3.3, transition branch. The main differences are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added backend support for server-side batik rendering;</li>
	<li>Integrated and improved DataMarket's Protovis MSIE/VML add-on for supporting IE 8;</li>
	<li>Added support for multiple event handlers per event;</li>
	<li>Added support for fill and stroke linear and radial gradients;</li>
	<li>Added the new line and area "smart" segmentation mode;</li>
	<li>Added support for miter limit and miter joins in the normal lines segmentation mode;</li>
	<li>Added support for delegation in mark's property functions, allowing to call base implementations of specified properties.</li>
</ul>
