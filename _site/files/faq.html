<p class="title">How do I add CCC charts to my dashboard?</p>
<p>CCC is integrated in CDE. In CDE, just look for the CCC components inside the Chart category. </p>

<p class="title">Is there a GUI for testing or evaluating CCC charts?</p>
<p>There is no GUI tool for this, but we have developed an interactive playground for that purpose. Go to the Charts menu in this site, pick the chart of your choice, and try the code.</p>

<p class="title">Does CCC require other CTools and the Pentaho Business Intelligence Server? </p>
<p>No, CCC is a plain JavaScript library and can be used standalone, as you can see in the Chart gallery above. </p>

<p class="title">Where can I find information about the changes made in CCC2? </p>
<p>We maintain a <a href="http://redmine.webdetails.org/projects/ccc/wiki/FAQ_Main_Changes_New_Features_CCC_v2" target="_blank" title="CCC2 FAQ Wiki">FAQ wiki</a> that covers this. It also shows how common customizations can be done in CCC2.</p>
