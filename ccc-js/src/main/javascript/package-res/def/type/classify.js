     * Obtains the class of a value, returning <tt>undefined</tt>, when there is none.
     *
     * Two kinds of "classes" are considered.
     *
     * The most obvious one is that of classes represented by a <i>constructor</i> function.
     * Instances of this kind of class are created by explicitly using the <tt>new</tt> operator,
     * as in <tt>var inst = new ClassConstructor()</tt>.
     * Unless explicitly changed, the class of an instance
     * created this way is present in its <i>constructor</i> property.
     *
     * The other less obvious one is that of classes represented by a <i>factory</i> function.
     * Factory functions are called directly and not using the <tt>new</tt> operator.
     * A factory function abstracts the code from the actual provenance of the instances it returns.
     * Additionally, a factory function is not required to create a new instance, every time it is called
     * (actually, constructor functions also have this ability, but it's a non-recommended pattern).
     * Knowledge of this kind of class relies on explicit annotation of an instance
     * by use of the {@link def.classify} function.
     *
     * Sometimes,
     * factory functions are used to wrap, and not to hide,
     * the creation of instances of regular JavaScript "classes",
     * possibly creating instances in special ways.
     *
     * A factory function like this can state the underlying constructor (or base one)
     * of the instances it creates,
     * by having that constructor in a property named <i>of</i>.
     * The function {@link def.is} will return <tt>true</tt> if
     * an instance of this constructor is tested against a factory stating it.
     *
     * This function gives precedence to the annotated class of an instance, when there is one,
     * falling back to the value of the <i>constructor</i> property, when not.
     * Lastly, when the value is not an object, or has no defined constructor,
     * the value <tt>undefined</tt> is returned.
     *
     * @param {any} v The value whose class is to be obtained.
     * @return {function|undefined} The class of the value, or <tt>undefined</tt>, when there is none.
